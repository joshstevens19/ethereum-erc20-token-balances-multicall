# ethereum-erc20-token-balances-multicall

This library will fetch all the token balances you want within 1 JSONRPC call. This solves long loading time when your trying to show balances for a lot of assets and brings down JSONRPC request limits. It also brings down the metadata for the token aka decimal places, name, symbol and balance. This will return in lighting speed if you compare that to say doing 50 seperate JSONRPC calls this brings the speed down around 50x.

This uses the ethereum-multicall which is a lightweight library for interacting with the [multicall](https://github.com/joshstevens19/ethereum-multicall) smart contract.

ethereum-erc20-token-balances-multicall is fully written in typescript so has full compile time support. The motivation of this package was to expose a super simple and easy to understand interface for you to take the full benefits of the fast loading of erc20 balances for users. Also to not being opinionated on how you use it, you can use it with web3 or ethers.
